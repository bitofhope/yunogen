# yunogen

The Yuno generator is an ncurses-based solution to a severe lack of adorableness in Unix-like operating systems.

Yunogen generates a widening ASCII art piece in likeness of Yuno from the Critically acclaimed manga series *Hidamari Sketch*.

Yunogen is written in C for performance, portability, and above all cuteness. It strives to be bloat free and follow the KISS principle.

    >twf Yuno will never be real ;_;
